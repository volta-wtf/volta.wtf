# Deployment

Learn how to deploy your documentation site to various platforms.

## Build for Production

First, create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This will generate an optimized production build in the `.next` directory.

## Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js documentation site:

1. Push your code to GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
2. Import your repository on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
3. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js and configure the build settings
4. Deploy!

```bash
# Or use Vercel CLI
npx vercel
```

### Netlify

Deploy to Netlify:

1. Connect your repository to Netlify
2. Configure build settings:
   - Build command: `pnpm build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`
3. Deploy

### Docker

Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine AS base

# Install dependencies only when needed
FROM base AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# Build the app
FROM base AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
RUN npm install -g pnpm && pnpm build

# Production image
FROM base AS runner
WORKDIR /app
ENV NODE_ENV production
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

Build and run:

```bash
docker build -t docs .
docker run -p 3000:3000 docs
```

## Environment Variables

Don't forget to configure environment variables in your deployment platform:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

## Custom Domain

Configure your custom domain in your hosting platform's settings:

1. Add your domain in the platform's dashboard
2. Update your DNS records to point to the platform
3. Wait for DNS propagation (usually a few minutes)

## Performance Tips

- Enable static generation for pages that don't change often
- Use image optimization
- Configure caching headers
- Enable compression
