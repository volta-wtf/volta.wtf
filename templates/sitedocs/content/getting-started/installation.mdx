# Installation

This guide will walk you through setting up your documentation site.

## Install Dependencies

First, install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

<Callout type="info">
You can also use `npm install` or `yarn install` if you prefer.
</Callout>

## Development Server

Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project structure:

```
├── app/              # Next.js app directory
├── components/       # React components
├── content/          # MDX documentation files
├── lib/              # Utility functions
├── styles/           # CSS styles
